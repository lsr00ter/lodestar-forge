title: Deployment Lifecycle
description: The lifecycle of a deployment within Lodestar Forge explained.
---

Forge deployments are complex and involve multiple stages. The deployment status indicates the current state or stage of the deployment. A brief overview of the lifecycle of a deployment is as follows.

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Stage 1: Ready to Prepare">
      At this stage the deployment is ready to prepare. Preparing the deployment can be done using the "Perpare" button in the "Deployment Status" card.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Stage 2: Preparing">
      The deployment is currently being prepared. This includes initiating terraform and creating the underlying network infrastructure and SSH keys.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Stage 3: Ready to Deploy">
      All underlying/required infrastructure has been created within the target cloud provider. [Infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure) must now be added to the deployment before proceeding to the next step.

      Once infrastructure has been added, the deployment can be deployed using the "Deploy" button in the "Deployment Status" card.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Stage 4: Deploying">
      The deployment&apos;s infrastructure is currently being deployed. This may take a while depending on the size and complexity of the deployment.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Stage 5: Ready to Configure">
      All defined Infrastructure has been created and can be configured. For more information on configuring infratucture refer to [this](/docs/infrastructure/configuring-infrastructure) guide. Configurations must be added to proceed.

      From this point, new infrastructure can be added and deployments can be redeployed at any time using the "Deploy" button in the "Deployment Status" card.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Stage 6: Configuring">
      The deployment&apos;s infrastructure is currently being configured. This may take a while depending on the size and complexity of the deployment.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Stage 7: Live">
      The deployment&apos;s infrastructure has been successfully deployed and configured. It is now live and ready for use.

      From this point, further configurations can be applied using the "Configure" button in the "Deployment Status" card.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Stage 8: Destroying">
      This stage is used when destroying the deployment and it&apos;s infrastructure.

      Details on how to destroy a deployment can be found [here](#deleting-a-deployment).
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Other Stages
Forge deployments support one other stages "Failed" which is not part of the normal lifecycle. This is outlined below.

### Failed
Hopefully you never see this stage. This stage is only used if the deployment failed to deploy or configure.

Check the logs for more information on why the deployment failed.
