description: A required cloud provider where infrastructure can be deployed.

One of the first steps to be taken once Forge is configured is to connect either an [AWS](/docs/integrations/aws) or DigitalOcean account. At least one cloud provider must be connected to use Forge, since it is required for deploying infrastructure.

## Digital Ocean Personal Access Tokens

The Digital Ocean integration requires a Digital Ocean Personal Access Token. Whilst this documentation does not cover how to create Personal Access Tokens, you can find instructions on how to do so [here](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/).

1. Select your account in the bottom left corner of the Forge dashboard.
2. Click the "Settings" button.
3. Select the "integrations" tab, then "Add Integration".
