## Project Overview

**Lodestar Forge** is more than just a web application. It's a **complete toolkit** designed for red team infrastructure creation. Given this, the platform consists of several key-components which you should be familiar with:

- **Forge Nucleus:** The "brains" of the platform, connecting all four components as a single API. Nucleus is responsible for the creation and configuration of infrastructure.
- **Forge Command:** The web interface used for easily interacting with the platform.
- **Forge Radar:** A lightweight, domain monitoring container, responsible for monitoring domain health and DNS records.
- **Forge Store:** A Postgres database, used for storing and managing data related to the platform. The database is interacted with through Drizzle ORM.
