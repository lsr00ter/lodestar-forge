title: Configuring Infrastructure
description: How to configure infrastructure within Lodestar Forge.
---

After your infrastructure has been created by Forge, it will only include Tailscale and any tools you defined within a custom user-data script. Therefore, how can you configure your infrastructure?

The configuration process involves using Ansible to automate the setup and configuration of your infrastructure. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to configure your infrastructure using Ansible.

## Prerequisites
Before you can configure your infrastructure, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- The necessary configuration templates within your Forge instance (more information [here](/docs/files-and-templates/configuration-templates)).
- Infrastructure is created and has the "Running" status.
- A Tailscale IP has been assigned to your infrastructure.

<Note>
    You can view the tailscale IP address of your infrastructure in the "Networking" section of the infrastructure overview.

## Adding Configurations
Once the above prerequisites are met, you can proceed to add configurations to your infrastructure. Here's how.

1. With a project selected, select the "Deployments" tab in the sidebar.
2. Select the deployment from the deployments table.
3. Select the infrastructure you wish to configure from the infrastructure table.
4. Click "Edit" then "Add configuration template" in the "Configuration" section.
5. Complete the form to add your configuration.
6. Click "Save" to confirm the configurations added.

## Applying Configurations
Once you have added your configurations, you must apply them to your infrastructure. Below are the steps on how to do this.

1. With a project selected, select the "Deployments" tab in the sidebar.
2. Select the deployment from the deployments table.
3. Click the "Configure" button in the "Deployment Status" section.
4. Wait for the configurations to be applied.
