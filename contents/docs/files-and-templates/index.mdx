title: Files and Templates
description: Files and templates used for deploying and configuring infrastructure.
---

Templates are a core component of Forge, allowing you to define, deploy, and configure infrastructure using both Terraform and Ansible. They provide a standardized way to create and manage infrastructure resources, ensuring consistency and reliability across different environments.

## Template Types

There are three types of files and templates used in Forge:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|[Infrastructure](/docs/files-and-templates/infrastructure-templates)|Terraform template for deploying infrastructure.|
|[Configuration](/docs/files-and-templates/configuration-templates)|Ansible template for configuring infrastructure.|
|[File](/docs/files-and-templates/files)|Files used during the configuration stages.|

## Template Varibles

Forge has custom template variables built-in to the template editor, allowing you to easily reuse templates across different environments.

<Note>
    More information about variable types can be found in each of the specific template sections.
</Note>

To define these variables within any of the files or templates, simply use the syntax `$$variableName$$`.
