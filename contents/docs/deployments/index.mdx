Deployments within Forge are a crucial component of the platform, grouping together pieces of infrastructure. You can create one large deployment containing all your infrastrucrure. Or the alternative, more modular, approach is to create individual deployments for different environments, such as malware-development, phishing, and command and control.

## Deployment Details

* **Deployment Name:** The name of the deployment, it is recommended to use a unique name for each deployment.
