title: Infrastructure Lifecycle
description: The lifecycle of infrastructure within Lodestar Forge explained.
---

Infrastructure within Forge have several stages. The stage of the infrastructure is indicated by its current "status" tag. An overview of the stages is provided below.

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Stage 1: Pending">
      At this stage the infrastructure has been added to Forge and is ready to be built. To deploy the infrastructure, click the "Deploy" button in the "Deployment Status" card.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Stage 2: Building">
      The infrastructure is currently being built using Terraform.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Stage 3: Running">
      The infrastructure is currently running with no issues.
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Stage 4: Configuring">
      The infrastructure is currently being configured using Ansible. After this is complete, the infrastructure will return to the "Running" status.
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

## Other Stages
Forge infrastructure supports two other stages, "Default" and "Failed" which are not part of the normal lifecycle. These are outlined below.

### Default
Any infrastructure which is default to Forge and cannot be modified is considered "default". This includes the default networking infrastructure which is created when a deployment is [prepared](/docs/deployments/deployment-lifecycle).

### Failed
Hopefully you never see this stage. This stage is only used if the infrastructure failed to deploy or configure.

Check the logs for more information on why the infrastructure failed.
