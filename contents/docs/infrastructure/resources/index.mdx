Any infrastructure which is created within Forge consists of resources. Resources are purely for informational purposes and cannot be modified. Each resource contains the following attributes which can be useful when debugging or manually modifying your infrastructure:

* **Identifier:** The Terraform resource type plus the resource name.
* **Forge ID:** The unique identifier assigned to the resource by Forge.
* **Provider ID:** The unique identifier assigned to the resourceby the cloud provider.

Primarily, a Forge resource is mapped to each Terraform resource defined within the [infrastructure template](/docs/files-and-templates/infrastructure-templates) used.
