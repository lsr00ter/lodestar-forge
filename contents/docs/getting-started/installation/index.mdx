Setting up Forge is designed to be quick and easy. Since Forge is a containerised application, the prerequisites are minimal, however, [Docker](https://www.docker.com) with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) is required.

## Quick Start
To get started, you can clone the Lodestar Forge repository directly from GitHub.

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Step 1: Clone the Forge Repository">
    Begin by cloning the Forge repository from GitHub:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/c0nf1den71al/Lodestar-Forge.git
    ```

  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 2: Access the Project Directory">
    After cloning, navigate into the project directory to start setting up:

    ```shell
    cd Lodestar-Forge
    ```

  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 3: Configure Environment Variables">
      Copy the `example.env` file to `.env` and update the required environment variables.

      ```shell
      cp example.env .env
      ```
  </StepperItem>

  <StepperItem title="Step 4: Start Forge">
    Finally, use Docker Compose to start Forge:

    ```shell
    docker compose up
    ```

    Alternatively, you can start Forge in development mode:

    ```shell
    docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
    ```
  </StepperItem>
</Stepper>

With this setup, youâ€™ll have a ready-to-use Forge instance to start building your infrastructure.
